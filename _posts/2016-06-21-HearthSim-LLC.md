As of today, HearthSim is officially a company. Born from its community, the
founders are @amw2104, @Epix37, @beheh and [myself](https://github.com/jleclanche).

There is so much I want to talk about. The community will still be there,
stronger than ever. The company will back our commercial work and allow us to
finance some of our projects.

Our current core project is [https://hsreplay.net/](HSReplay.net). I've wanted
to talk about it for a long time now.
Games played with [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://hsdecktracker.net/) can
automatically be uploaded to the website. Our Hearthstone Replayer,
[Joust](https://github.com/HearthSim/joust), lets us display those games on the
website, replay them from the beginning, seek through them, analyze them and
more.

The large amount of games we are expecting to receive will allow for extremely
advanced analysis of Hearthstone. How it's played, how the meta evolves, what
is and isn't popular.
HSReplay.net is open source (repository to be made available very soon), built
on a Django stack. If you are interested in contributing, reach out directly on
the Github issue tracker or in the `#hearthsim` IRC channel!

If you want to try out the HSReplay.net beta test, join `#HSReplay` on Freenode
and download the HDT client from [this page](https://hsreplay.net/pages/beta/).
