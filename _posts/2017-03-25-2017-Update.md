The past six months have been some of the busiest ones at HearthSim, which is
incidentally why updates on this blog have been sparse. I thought it was about
time I gave an update on what we've been up to!

Since last September, we have released [HSReplay.net Articles](https://hsreplay.net/articles/),
where we have been directly posting updates on HSReplay.net as well as Hearthstone
Meta / Replay analysis articles.

These articles, as well as other articles currently in the making, have all been
guest posts by Baney, Dereck Toker and [HearthVis](https://hearthvis.com/). We
have been blessed with very enthusiastic researchers of all backgrounds, wishing
to do research based on HearthSim data.
As a result of that, we have opened a mailing list for research projects. We want
to extend our full support projects researching AI and HearthStone simulation.
If you are in this situation, reach out to me on Discord and I will invite you!

[HSTracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/HSTracker), a macOS port of Hearthstone
Deck Tracker, has joined the HearthSim Developer Community and added support for
HSReplay.net. It's been growing steadily since, and @ifeherva contributed a very
impressive C++ port of [HearthMirror](https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthMirror)
to use in the tracker, which we will soon switch over to in HDT as well.

[Sunwell](https://github.com/HearthSim/Sunwell), our card renderer, has gotten a
massive update. It's been ported from JavaScript into TypeScript, has received a
plethora of performance improvements, fixes and new features, and a standalone
NodeJS card renderer is now also availale. Both Sunwell and HearthstoneJSON are
now available [in the NPM HearthSim org](https://www.npmjs.com/org/hearthsim).

A new simulator, [SabberStone](https://github.com/HearthSim/SabberStone), has
joined our ranks and together with @Citiral and @BertP, @darkfriend77 has done
incredible work on our server and simulation infrastructure.

We published [decrunch](https://github.com/HearthSim/decrunch), a Python library
for interfacing with the `crunch.h` DXT compression library. This allows us to
support crunched textures in [UnityPack](https://github.com/HearthSim/UnityPack).

Speaking of UnityPack, we are currently in the process of rewriting it in C++.
Although the design is solid, parsing is in need of a second iteration - and the
need to interface with UnityPack in other languages has repeatedly come up. The
next generation of UnityPack will therefore be a C-compatible library, with
bindings in Python, C# and Swift.

We've been made an [official Discord partner](https://discordapp.com/partners)
after opening a new Discord server for the greater HearthSim user community.
This website (HearthSim.info), as well as the GitHub HearthSim organization, are
now referred to as the **HearthSim Developer Community**, or just **HearthSim
Developers** for short. This contrasts with the new community we have been
cultivating, the **HearthSim User Community** or just **HearthSim Community** for
short.

Our Discord servers are:
* <https://discord.gg/hearthsim-devs> for the HearthSim Developer Community.
* <https://discord.gg/hearthsim> for the HearthSim User Community.

Of course, the HearthSim Developer Discord is still being mirrored on both IRC
and Gitter, thanks to @42wim's great work on [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/).

The lovely [HearthBot](https://github.com/HearthSim/HearthBot), our Discord bot
for card search, has also been made available as a public bot. Send a PM to
**HearthBot#4400** on Discord with `!help` and/or `!invite` for instructions on
how to invite it to your own server!

We also went to [BlizzCon 2016](https://blizzcon.com), which was an incredible
experience. We were invited to the Blizzard campus, met up with a lot of Team 5
people and had an amazing experience.

But of course, the main thing we've been working on is **HearthSim Premium**.
Expenses have been really high since the initial release of the site; we are
processing well over a million replays every day. The infrastructure behind this
requires a business model and we think our Premium offering will attract players
of all sorts and allow us to continue making the replay service available for
free, as well as fund the development of all the tools we are supporting.

The Premium offer is part of a greater release of features on HSReplay.net which
we are calling **HSReplay.net Statistics**. It is a set of statistical analytics
which includes a database of cards and decks with graphs on popularity and
winrates over time, Mulligan statistics, loads of dedicated graphs such as top
Discover picks, top targets for cards, and much more. Premium offers some extra
graphs and features, such as matchup filters, granular time ranges and personal
card statistics.

We are aiming to launch publicly within the next couple of weeks.
It's been a very active half-year, I have barely touched the tip of the iceberg
of cool stuff we worked on during that time.

I'm looking forward to the other half.
