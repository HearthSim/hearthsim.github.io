With the beta release of [HSReplay.net](https://hsreplay.net), we now have a lot of games coming our way.

There aren't enough users in the system just yet to do accurate analysis of the brawl, but we thought this
would be a good introduction to the statistics we intend to run semi-regularly off the database.

Here is the matchup winrates table for **1566** matches.

**Disclaimer: The sample size is not large enough to truly be representative of the brawl's meta.
It is enough however to form an idea of what each deck's winrate is like.**

| -       | DRUID   | HUNTER   | MAGE   | PALADIN   | PRIEST   | ROGUE   | SHAMAN   | WARLOCK   | WARRIOR   |
|:--------|:--------|:---------|:-------|:----------|:---------|:--------|:---------|:----------|:----------|
| DRUID   | -       | 50.0%    | 45.3%  | 48.4%     | 37.9%    | 77.4%   | 58.1%    | 36.4%     | 27.7%     |
| HUNTER  | 50.0%   | -        | 36.9%  | 46.7%     | 38.1%    | 58.1%   | 40.9%    | 25.0%     | 37.1%     |
| MAGE    | 54.7%   | 63.1%    | -      | 65.0%     | 51.2%    | 42.0%   | 45.3%    | 49.4%     | 53.3%     |
| PALADIN | 51.6%   | 53.3%    | 35.0%  | -         | 52.0%    | 44.8%   | 43.3%    | 13.6%     | 18.2%     |
| PRIEST  | 62.1%   | 61.9%    | 48.8%  | 48.0%     | -        | 51.7%   | 50.0%    | 40.7%     | 51.5%     |
| ROGUE   | 22.6%   | 41.9%    | 58.0%  | 55.2%     | 48.3%    | -       | 57.6%    | 44.7%     | 50.0%     |
| SHAMAN  | 41.9%   | 59.1%    | 54.7%  | 56.7%     | 50.0%    | 42.4%   | -        | 43.5%     | 45.0%     |
| WARLOCK | 63.6%   | 75.0%    | 50.6%  | 86.4%     | 59.3%    | 55.3%   | 56.5%    | -         | 50.0%     |
| WARRIOR | 72.3%   | 62.9%    | 46.7%  | 81.8%     | 48.5%    | 50.0%   | 55.0%    | 50.0%     | -         |

Overall winrates:

| DRUID | HUNTER | MAGE  | PALADIN | PRIEST | ROGUE | SHAMAN | WARLOCK | WARRIOR |
|:------|--------|-------|---------|--------|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| 46.6% | 43.1%  | 52.6% | 40.2%   | 51.4%  | 48.6% | 49.2%  | 57.5%   | 55.6%   |


We were also able to pinpoint popularity of each class in the brawl.

With more data, we could normalize the winrates against class popularity. In this scenario, it would
only be misleading however.

We are hoping to get much more accurate numbers for the next few brawls. If you'd like to participate,

We want to thank every player who has been part of the HSReplay.net HDT beta test. The final release
should be coming in the next few days!
