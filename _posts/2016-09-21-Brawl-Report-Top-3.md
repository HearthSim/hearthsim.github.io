This week's brawl, "Top 3", was by far the most popular brawl since [HSReplay.net](https://hsreplay.net)
went into Beta, with over **48000** Top 3 games uploaded to the website.

The rules of this brawl are simple: Pick three unique cards, your deck will be composed of
10 copies of each. *Find the best combo*. It is a variant on the "Top 2" Tavern Brawl that ran
a few months ago.

## Popularity analysis

So why is this brawl so popular?
The games are *extremely quick*. **65% of games were over by turn 5**. And by turn 10, that
number goes up to 96%.

In fact, early concedes happened so much that we had to compensate for it quite a bit while
gathering statistics - nearly 50% of games were over before the opponent revealed a single card!

Taking a closer look at how our users played this Tavern Brawl, we see that on average,
**seven Top 3 games** were played per user, nearly twice as many as the games played on
*Cart Crash at the Crossroads*.


## Deck winrates

In the following table, we look at the top decks this brawl. By far the most popular deck was
Mill Druid running Coldlight Oracle, Innervate and Naturalize, run by nearly 20% of players,
despite the deck barely making the top 15 by winrate.

The highest winrate deck was Annoy-o-Tron / Mechwarper / Metaltooth Leaper, a variant on the
popular Mechwarper / Metaltooth Leaper from the Top 2 brawl.

*Disclaimer: All decks in the following tables have at least 100 games accounted for.*

## Mill Druid analysis

*Disclaimer: Due to the extremely high amounts of early concedes, the data here may be biased*.

It is quite incredible that Mill Druid is over three times as popular as the next most popular
deck (Malchezaar's Imp / Silverware Golem / Soulfire, sitting just below 6%).

So what does this deck beat? Here are the top 5 matchups in favour of Mill Druid:

* Innervate / Wild Growth / Yogg-Saron - 97.5% winrate
* Innervate / Raven Idol / Yogg-Saron - 92% winrate
* Arcane Missiles / Mana Wyrm / Mirror Image - 75% winrate
* Malchezaar's Imp / Silverware Golem / Soulfire - 75% winrate
* Arcane Intellect / Forgotten Torch / Sorcerer's Apprentice - 70% winrate

We see that Mill Druid beats Yogg-Saron decks nearly all the time.

And what beats Mill Druid?

* Annoy-o-Tron / Mechwarper / Metaltooth Leaper - 82% winrate
* Astral Communion / Innervate / Prince Malchezaar - 67% winrate
* Fist of Jaraxxus / Malchezaar's Imp / Soulfire - 59% winrate


## Winner of the Brawl

With a whopping **82% winrate against the most popular deck of the brawl**, as well as a strong lead
on all other decks' winrates, the **Annoy-o-Tron/Mechwarper/Metaltooth Leaper** combo was the absolute
best deck to run this week!

As it turns out, [31 damage on the board on turn 3]({{ page.disgusting }}) is *preeeettty good*.
