The HearthSim community's main hang out is the `#hearthsim` channel on Freenode.
We are also in the `#hearthsim-ai` channel for AI discussions and the `#hsreplay`
channel for the [HSReplay website](https://hsreplay.net/).

You can use the [Freenode Webchat]({{ site.vars.links.webchat }})
to join us and say hi. We recommend [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/)
as a more permanent web client, or [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org/) as a
desktop IRC client. Logs are available [on Gitter]({{ site.vars.links.gitter }}).

We're also in the [/r/hearthsim](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthsim) and
[/r/hsreplay](https://www.reddit.com/r/hsreplay) subreddits.

Discussions from the previous AI mailing list are still available in the
[Google Groups archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hearthstone-simulator-dev).

To contact us directly, you can also email us at <contact@hearthsim.info>.
