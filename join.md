## Chat

The HearthSim developer community's main hang out is on IRC/Discord.
The channel is mirrored between the two, you can use either!

* IRC: #HearthSim on chat.freenode.net &mdash; <a href="{{ site.vars.links.irccloud }}" target="_blank"><img src="{{ shields_irc }}" height="20"></a>
* Discord: [Instant invite]({{ site.vars.links.discord.devs }})
* Gitter (extra mirror; logs): [HearthSim/HearthSim]({{ site.vars.links.gitter }})

Subreddits:

* [/r/HearthSim]({{ site.vars.links.reddit.hearthsim }})
* [/r/HSReplay]({{ site.vars.links.reddit.hsreplay }})

Discussions from the previous AI mailing list are still available in the
[Google Groups archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hearthstone-simulator-dev).
